# appFinder
This project is a Telegram bot written in [Golang](https://golang.org/) for searching Apple's AppStore and getting details for any particular app.

Also it uses [Redis](https://redis.io/) for cache storage and [telegram-bot-api](http://gopkg.in/telegram-bot-api.v4) library for interacting with Telegram Api.

Actually it's a personal experience with [Golang](https://golang.org/) and [Redis](https://redis.io/).
